Alerts
it is small message box which appears on screen yo give some info or notification

Alert is a pop up message. Alert takes complete focus from the webpage we are working.
We can not proceed further w/o handling an alert.

3 types of alerts:
1. web based / html alerts --> we cam simply inspect and perform action
2. Javascript alert / browser alerts --> we can handle by using switchTo() method
3. Windows based alerts --> we can not  handle with selenium

Types of JS Alerts:
1. simple alert - click on
2. confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
3. prompt alert - enter text click ok

We can handle Alerts from Alert Interface

To handle JS alert we only have 4 methods available:
1. accept()
2. dismiss()
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()

Frames

Frames allow developers to present multiple views in one webpage.

3 ways to interact with frames:
1. By ID or Name
2. By WebElement
3. By Index
