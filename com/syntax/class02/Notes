What is WebElement?
Anything we see on the webpage is considered to be a webelement
e.g. buttons, dropdowns, textboxes, checkboxes.

What is HTML?
HyperText Markup Language

What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a browser's internal view of the webpage.
Also called Developer's tools
Document -- it can be stored any document like pdf excel or word
Object -- any line inside HTML is called an object.
Model -- layout of the HTML class

Locator:
is a address or a position of an webelement in the webpage
is used to locate or identify a specific element on the webpage

8 Locators:
-- id
-- name
-- className
-- linkText
-- partialLinkText
-- xpath
-- cssSelector
-- tagName

HTML scripting meaning
purple -- tags, they are surrounded by <>
orange -- attributes
blue -- attribute values

Why do we need many locators?
-- Developers not provide all the locators for webelements
-- Some locators may have duplicate values in the other notes
-- Some locators may not be used applicable to all the elements,
   e.g. linkText and PartialLinkText are only applicable for link

"a" tag in HTML is called an anchor tag
