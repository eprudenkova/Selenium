Handling multiple windows:
In order to handle multiple windows we will be using:
 getWindowHandle() - one
 getWindowHandles() - multiple

Window handle:
window handle is a unique ID the holds the address of the window or tab
It is a 40 alphanumeric character ID

Synchronization
is a process of bringing the speed of two or more components at the same level
in our case we are trying to match our script and page loading speed

Thread.sleep(1000) --> static wait / unconditional wait

Types of Selenium Waits:
Implicit
Explicit
Fluent

Implicit Wait
tells your WebDriver to wait for a sertain amount of time before throwing an exception
Implicit Wait is written only once and will be applied for the whole session/execution. We can say implicit
wait is also a global wait.

Implicit wait is usually set to 20 sec.
If your element is located in 3 sec the rest time will be ignore.

Implicit Wait will be applied only for findElement() or findElements() methods

navigate() do not wait fully load
get() wait fully load
